[Heron's Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula) is a method for calculating the **area** of a [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle) when the lengths of all three sides are known. This formula is attributed to **Heron of Alexandria**.

## Formula Overview

Given the three side lengths of a [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle):

- ***`a`*** = first side
- ***`b`*** = second side
- ***`c`*** = third side

### Step 1: Calculate the Semi-Perimeter ***`s`***

The [semi-perimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiperimeter) is half the [perimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter) of the [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle) and is calculated as:

```math
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
```

### Step 2: Calculate the [Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area) ***`A`***

The area of the triangle is determined using the following formula:

```math
A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
```

---

## Example

### Input:
Let the sides of the triangle be:

- `a = 5`
- `b = 6`
- `c = 7`

### Calculation:
1. Compute the [semi-perimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiperimeter):
   ```math
   s = \frac{5 + 6 + 7}{2} = 9
   ```

2. Compute the area:
   ```math
   A = \sqrt{9(9 - 5)(9 - 6)(9 - 7)}
   ```
   ```math
   A = \sqrt{9 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{216} \approx 14.7
   ```

### Output:
The area of the triangle is approximately **14.7 square units**.

## Applications

- [Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry) and [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry) problems
- Engineering and architecture
- Computational graphics and simulations
- Heron's Formula works for any triangle, as long as the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side ([triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality)).
